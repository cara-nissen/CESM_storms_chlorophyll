# Analysis scripts for "The imprint of Southern Ocean storms on surface chlorophyll, their drivers and satellite biases"
Code for data postprocessing and figure creation in [ADD LINK TO PAPER ONCE PUBLISHED]

## Plotting 

Scripts are named following the figure numbering in the paper (main + supplement). 

## Post-processing

These scripts are needed to postprocess the original model output, i.e., regridding to the JRA mesh, calculating storm-induced anomalies, and calculating composites of the anomalies.

The postprocessed composites of the model output can be found on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14232754).
